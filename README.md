# Powerhot VR
_(working title)_

Team Powerhot does Hack Week!

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repo
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm start`

## Resources
I strongly recommend [reading the first few pages of the A-Frame documentation](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/introduction/) to get familiar with the ECS concept and some best practices for A-Frame development.

## Notes
We're using [aframe-boilerplate](https://github.com/aframevr/aframe-boilerplate/) as a starting point here, with only minor dev environment modifications.
